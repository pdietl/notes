# Newsletters

I find weekly newsletters a convenient way for digesting information. It works as follows: someone prepares a curated list of links on a particular topic: articles, blog posts, news, pull requests, etc. and sends it weekly by e-mail to all subscribers. Then, I, instead of reading, say, HackerNews every day I can just read manually selected and classified top links of the whole week on Friday.
