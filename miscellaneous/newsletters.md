# Newsletters

I find weekly newsletters a convenient way for digesting information. It works as follows: someone knowledgeable prepares a curated list of links on a particular topic: articles, blog posts, news, pull requests, etc. and sends it weekly by e-mail to all subscribers. Then you can save time by skimming through the best links on, say, Friday instead of reading them one by one throughout the week.

### Currently subscribed to:

* [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com/) - "Best articles on startups, technology, programming, and more. All links are curated by hand from Hacker News". If you choose the only one of those I recommend this newsletter, it's simply the best.
* [Better Dev Link](https://betterdev.link/) - "Weekly links to help you become a better developer"
* [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) - "Handpicked Rust updates, delivered to your inbox"
* [Haskell Weekly](https://haskellweekly.news/) - "Each issue features several hand-picked links to interesting content about Haskell from around the web."
* [Julia Evans blog weekly digest](https://jvns.ca/newsletter/) - great technical blog covering many topics in a simple to understand manner, I would call it project-oriented.
